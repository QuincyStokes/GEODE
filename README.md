# GEODE

Geode is an open world survival TOWER DEFENSE game, currently being almost entirely solo developed by me! (Art is done by Annika Stokes)

Geode takes place in a strangely corrupt world, where meteors that landed on the surface thousands of years ago are now eroding away, revealing strange crystals and minerals. 
These crystals are having all sorts of affects in the environment, and you must survive and explore for as long as you can.

There is no current build because the core gameplay loop is not finished, but stay tuned!
